## How To Use These Files

* The files that include '*' in its name are some reference files or scripts. These scripts represent some of the author's thoughts the process of conducting the project. So there is no need to run these files rather than just take a look at them.
* The Unload data file indicates how to extract the data. We want to extract two sets of data, one set extracts 'program' and the other extracts 'program_type' in order to simplify model. Note that in both dataset, we would like to explore the ads with cost greater than 0.
* The Visualization 
* The Modeling 

## How To Run
* Extract data and find out the its feature
* Discover Kevin's method and reconstract his model
* Data understading
* Construct model-Averaging, Lasso Regression, Regression Trees Random Forest and Projection Persuit Regression
* Comparing mean percent absolute error among different methods and find out how they distributed
